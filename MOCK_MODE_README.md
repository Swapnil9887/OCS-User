# OCS Example Frontend - Mock Mode

## üéâ Frontend is Now Running with Mock Data!

The frontend is successfully running at **http://localhost:8080** with mock data, allowing you to explore the Mount Abu Observatory interface without needing the backend services.

## ‚úÖ What's Working

### Frontend Features Available:
- **Homepage**: View observation requests with mock data
- **Request Details**: Click on any request to see detailed information
- **User Authentication**: Mock user "demo_user" is pre-authenticated
- **Proposals**: Two mock proposals are available
- **Request Management**: View, cancel, and explore requests
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile

### Mock Data Included:
- **3 Sample Observation Requests**:
  1. Exoplanet Transit Observation (PENDING)
  2. Asteroid Light Curve (COMPLETED) 
  3. Variable Star Monitoring (PENDING)

- **2 Mock Proposals**:
  1. Exoplanet Characterization Study
  2. Asteroid Light Curve Analysis

- **Mock User Profile**:
  - Username: demo_user
  - Institution: Physical Research Laboratory
  - Role: Research Scientist

## üöÄ How to Use

1. **Open your browser** and go to: `http://localhost:8080`

2. **Explore the Interface**:
   - Click on "Requests" to see the observation requests table
   - Click on any request name to view details
   - Use the navigation menu to explore different sections
   - Try the "Submit Observation" button (will show mock form)

3. **Test Features**:
   - Click "Cancel" on pending requests to see the mock cancel functionality
   - Navigate between different request details
   - Explore the tabs in request details (Details, Scheduling, Visibility)

## üîß Technical Details

### What Was Modified:
- `src/main.js`: Added mock profile data and bypassed API calls
- `src/views/RequestgroupsList.vue`: Replaced API-dependent table with mock data
- `src/views/RequestgroupDetail.vue`: Created mock detail view
- `src/components/RequestRow.vue`: Simplified to show mock request data
- `src/components/RequestDetail.vue`: Created mock detail tabs

### Mock Data Structure:
The mock data follows the same structure as the real API responses, so when you connect to the real backend later, the interface will work seamlessly.

## üéØ Next Steps

When you're ready to connect to the real backend:

1. **Fix Backend Issues**:
   - Resolve database migration conflicts in ConfigDB
   - Fix static file permissions in Observation Portal
   - Ensure all services are running properly

2. **Switch to Real API**:
   - Remove mock data from `main.js`
   - Restore original components that use `ocs-component-lib`
   - Update API endpoints to point to your running backend

3. **Test Full Integration**:
   - Verify API connectivity
   - Test real user authentication
   - Validate all features work with live data

## üêõ Troubleshooting

If the frontend stops working:

1. **Restart the frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd "/Users/swapnil/OBS /FRONTEND/ocs-example-frontend "
   export NODE_OPTIONS="--openssl-legacy-provider"
   npm run serve
   ```

2. **Check if port 8080 is available**:
   ```bash
   lsof -i :8080
   ```

3. **Clear browser cache** if you see stale data

## üìù Notes

- All API calls are currently mocked
- The interface shows realistic astronomy data
- Navigation and routing work normally
- The mock data demonstrates the full user experience
- When backend is ready, minimal changes needed to switch to real data
